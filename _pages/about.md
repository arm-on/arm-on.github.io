Nowadays, many people learn languages through apps and websites. Some online materials can be helpful in passing university or college exams. These resources have been prepared by volunteers who share their insights using their own words, making complex concepts easier to grasp for others. Considering the benefits of this modern culture, I thought I could play a positive role in this whole story by sharing my thoughts and experiences. My posts will be mainly about my own reading materials including English literature, German books for beginners, and many topics related to computer science in which I am majoring at university.
